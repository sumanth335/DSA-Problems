/*Approach:  
Approach of remove(): 
    run the meet pointer entirely in the loop an check whether start pointer 
    has reached the loop head or not.

Working: 
    In the beginning the slow and fast pointer start from same position, 
    dist between them is 0, on first iteration dist becomes 1, second iteration dist becomes 2,
    with every iteration distance between slow and fast pointers increase by 1,

    So when the distance between them becomes equal to the lenght of the Cycle or Loop,
    they meet.
    NOTE: In case of Circular LinkedList where tail points to head, slow and fast pointer always
    meets where they start from, if they start from HEAD they meet at HEAD*/
